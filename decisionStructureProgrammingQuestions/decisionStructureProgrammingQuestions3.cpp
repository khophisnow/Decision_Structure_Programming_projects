// Mass and Weight
// Scientists measure an object’s mass in kilograms and its weight in Newtons. If you
// know the amount of mass of an object, you can calculate its weight, in Newtons,
// with the following formula:
// Weight = Mass × 9.8
// Design a program that asks the user to enter an object’s mass, and then calculates
// its weight. If the object weighs more than 1,000 Newtons, display a message indi-
// cating that it is too heavy. If the object weighs less than 10 Newtons, display a
// message indicating that it is too light.
