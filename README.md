# 🛡️ Decision Structure Programming Projects – Cyber Console Mode 🧠
Hands-on solutions to decision structure exercises from the Gaddis C++ Programming textbook. Implemented using modular design principles and wrapped in a themed "Cyber Mode" console interface for an engaging software-dev meets cybersecurity learning experience.

This C++ project is a collection of decision structure exercises (control flow, branching, logic-based problems) built with a clean, modular, and security-themed interface.

## 🚀 About the Project

After completing Modular Programming exercises, this series explores decision structures using:

- 📦 **Namespace modules** like `ds1::run()` for each task
- 🖥️ **Cyber-themed UI** with box-drawn menus and emojis
- 🧪 **Clean Makefile builds**
- 🧠 **Control logic** using `switch`, `if`, validation, and looping
- 🧰 **Scalable design** for adding new exercises easily

## ✅ Completed Exercises

| Exercise | Description                | Module   |
|----------|----------------------------|----------|
| 1        | Roman Numerals Converter   | `ds1`    |
| 2–11     | *(To be completed)*        | `ds2–ds11` |

## 🛠️ Build & Run

```bash
# Compile the project
make

# Run the Cyber Console
./decisionStructureProgram
```

## 🧠 Sample: Roman Numerals Converter (ds1)

```
[SECURE_INPUT] Enter a number (1–10) or 0 to exit:
➤ Roman Numeral: VIII
```

> 💬 Input validation, `switch-case`, and console UI included.
