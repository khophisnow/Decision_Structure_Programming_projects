# 🛡️ Decision Structure Programming Projects – Cyber Console Mode 🧠

Hands-on solutions to decision structure exercises from the Gaddis C++ Programming textbook. Implemented using modular design principles and wrapped in a themed **Cyber Mode** console interface for an engaging software-dev meets cybersecurity learning experience.

This C++ project is a collection of decision structure exercises (control flow, branching, logic-based problems) built with a clean, modular, and security-themed interface.

## 🚀 About the Project

After completing Modular Programming exercises, this series explores decision structures using:

- 📦 **Namespace modules** like `ds1::run()` for each task
- 🖥️ **Cyber-themed UI** with box-drawn menus and emoji feedback
- 🧪 **Clean Makefile builds**
- 🧠 **Control logic** using `switch`, `if`, validation, and looping
- 🧰 **Rerun logic** for repeatable testing of each module
- 🧩 **Scalable design** for easily extending to all 11 exercises

## ✅ Completed Exercises

| Exercise | Description                         | Module   |
|----------|-------------------------------------|----------|
| 1        | 🛡️ Roman Numerals Converter          | `ds1`    |
| 2        | 📐 Greater Rectangle Area Comparator | `ds2`    |
| 3–11     | *(Coming soon...)*                  | `ds3–ds11` |

Each module uses secure input handling, dynamic cyber console UI, and modular headers.

---

## 🛠️ Build & Run

```bash
# Compile the project
make

# Run the Cyber Console
./decisionStructureProgram
```

---

## 🧠 Sample: Rectangle Area Comparator (ds2)

```bash
[SECURE_INPUT] Provide dimensions of two rectangles
➤ Area of Rectangle I  : 25
➤ Area of Rectangle II : 30
➤ Rectangle II has the greater area 🔺
```

> 💬 Each exercise supports rerun without restarting the program.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- C++11/14
- Standard IO + error handling
- Modular headers (`.h` + `.cpp`)
- Emoji + ASCII-based UI design
- Makefile for automation
